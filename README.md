Search and manage users and groups in Windows AD

# Overview
I wrote this project to help me manage users and groups within Windows AD. It's a pretty common task to add a new user to our application AD group. It's also useful just to see if a user has a particular group. I used this as an excuse to circle back on WPF and the MVVM pattern. Hopefully I can continue to improve the codebase as I go.
